# Tunable-Bandstop-Filter
This Paper presents a new age Tunable Bandstop Filter prototype using CMOS RF MEMS Capacitors.
The proposed Circuit is designed to achieve an Insertion loss of 1.1 dB with and actuation of 5dB. The microstrip realization of the following filter can handled frequency up to 110-150 GHZ.It has theoretically zero Return Loss. The varactor used in the given circuit is an Angular Vertical Comb Driven Capacitor and the techniques for achieving low insertion loss and zero return loss theoretically has been used.
